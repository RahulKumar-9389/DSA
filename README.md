# Daily DSA Practice

Welcome to my Daily DSA Practice repository! This is a personal collection where I’ll track my progress in learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) by pushing daily questions that I solve. This repo serves as both a study tool and a way to maintain my consistency.

## Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to:
- Keep a record of the DSA questions I solve daily.
- Help reinforce my learning by revisiting problems.
- Monitor my progress over time.

## Repository Structure

Each day, I will create a new file or folder to log the questions I’ve worked on, along with my solutions and any notes I have.


## How to Use This Repository

1. **Daily Log**: Each day's file will include the questions I worked on, my solutions, and any challenges I faced.
2. **Review**: I can revisit past questions and solutions to reinforce my understanding.
3. **Consistency**: Committing daily helps me stay accountable and track my learning journey.

## Topics Covered

I will focus on various DSA topics, including but not limited to:
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Trees
- Graphs
- Sorting and Searching Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
- Backtracking
- Greedy Algorithms

## How I Will Contribute

- I will push my daily solutions to this repo.
- I’ll include notes on what I learned from each question.
- I may also include additional resources or references that helped me understand the concepts better.
