1. What is stack?
    stack is linear data structure that follows last in firtst (LIFO) out principle. That means that last element addedd to the stack is the firts one to be removed.

2. Basic Operations:
    (i)   push -: adds an element to the top in the stack
    (ii)  pop -: Remove the top element
    (iii) top -: Returns the top element of the stack
    (iv)  size -: Returns the numbers of the elements

push(1);
push(2);
push(3);
push(4);

[1, 2, 3, 4];

4 is top element;

pop(); remove the top element
Now 3 is the top element

top(); Returns the top element which is 3
