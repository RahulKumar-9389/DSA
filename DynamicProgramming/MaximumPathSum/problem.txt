Given:
    An N*M matrix filled with integer numbers.


Task:
    Find the maximum sum that can be obtained from a path starting from any cell in the first row to any cell in the last row.



Movement Rules:
    From a cell at position (row, col), you can move to one of the following positions in the next row:
    Down: (row+1, col)
    Down left diagonal: (row+1, col-1)
    Down right diagonal: (row+1, col+1)


Objective:
    Determine the maximum sum achievable following the allowed movements from any cell in the first row to any cell in the last row.
