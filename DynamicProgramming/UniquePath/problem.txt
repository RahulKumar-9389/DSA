Given M x N matrix.
You are present at point A which is top left cell of matrix.
Your destination is point B which is bottom-right cell of the matrix.


Your task is to find the total number of unique paths from the cell MATRIX[0][0] to MATRIX['M' - 1]['N' - 1].


To traverse in the matrix, you can either move Right or Down at each step. For example in a given point MATRIX[i] [j], you can move to either MATRIX[i + 1][j] or MATRIX[i][j + 1].
